Here's a simple way to create a basic image slider in WordPress for your theme, using the Orbit script from Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Advanced Custom Fields&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, install &lt;a href="http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/‎"&gt;Advanced Custom Fields&lt;/a&gt; on your WordPress site. This is not meant to be an ACF tutorial, but basically, this is what you do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install and activate the plugin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the "Custom Fields" entry near the bottom of the left-hand menu in WordPress. Add a new field group and give it an appropriate name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For this project, add five image fields which will output "Image ID". I usually make the first field mandatory and the others optional.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a rule for what page (or post type) you want to have the custom fields appear on. I generally use "page = front page".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hook up Foundation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're already using Foundation on your project, that's great! Otherwise, head off to &lt;a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/"&gt;http://foundation.zurb.com/&lt;/a&gt; and download a Foundation pack containing at least the Orbit CSS styles. Personally, I use the SCSS version of Foundation. In any case, make sure that your stylesheet contains the CSS styles for the Orbit slider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Javascript&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also make sure that your theme is using the correct Javascript files for Orbit. You'll need the basic Foundation javascript file as well as the Orbit-specific javascript. Lastly, see the &lt;a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/orbit.html"&gt;Foundation Orbit documentation&lt;/a&gt; for some tips and tricks as well as the javascript setup to make your slider work. See the "Using the Javascript" section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;OK, putting all this together in your WordPress theme&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the meat and potatoes. I've created a Gist with this code to refer to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/aaronjamesyoung/7208509"&gt;Orbit Slider Github Gist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your theme - perhaps in your &lt;code&gt;front-page.php&lt;/code&gt; file - is where that code goes. Here's a breakdown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$image1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;wp_get_attachment_image_src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;get_field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;slider_1&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;home-slider-size&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$image2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;wp_get_attachment_image_src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;get_field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;slider_2&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;home-slider-size&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$image3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;wp_get_attachment_image_src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;get_field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;slider_3&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;home-slider-size&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$image4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;wp_get_attachment_image_src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;get_field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;slider_4&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;home-slider-size&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$image5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;wp_get_attachment_image_src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;get_field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;slider_5&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;home-slider-size&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This sets up the variables for each image URL that you've entered in Advanced Custom Fields. Each variable in this case contains an array, the first element of which is the URL for the image. So in order to use these variables, you'll need to write, e.g., &lt;code&gt;echo $image1[0];&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also used my &lt;code&gt;functions.php&lt;/code&gt; file to define a custom image size for the slider images, called "home-slider-size".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we'll write the markup for the Orbit slider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;ul&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;data-orbit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;?php echo $image1[0]; ?&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php if(get_field(&amp;#39;slider_2&amp;#39;)) { ?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;?php echo $image2[0]; ?&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php } ?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  ... and so on ...
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This way, we have a mandatory first image for the slider (which will just sit there if there are no other images). Subsequent images are optional - so if you don't need to use five different slides at one time, that's OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a nice, easy way for clients to manage the slider (if they need one) on the home page of their website. I often have optional captions per slide as well via Advanced Custom Fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I often find that many of the prepackaged WordPress carousel plugins are either overkill, too simple, not customizable enough, or too difficult for clients to use easily. This way they can just go to edit their home page to update the carousel, which is generally pretty intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="wordpress"></category><category term="foundation"></category><category term="code"></category></entry><entry><title>Fall in Salem</title><link href="http://ajy.co/personal/fall-in-salem" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-10-27T21:45:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Aaron James Young</name></author><id>tag:ajy.co,2013-10-27:personal/fall-in-salem</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The new site isn't 100% yet, but it's much better.

&lt;p&gt;This fall's colors have been great - better than most falls because of our sunny weather with cool nights through October this year. Apparently that's great conditions for colorful leaves.

Geany is a great editor - fast and lightweight with plenty of features - but unfortunately, it doesn't highlight SCSS syntax out-of-the-box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did some Google searching and didn't really come up with anything at first (besides a custom fork of the program), so I set Geany aside. SCSS/SASS is pretty mission-critical for my workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I had a little more time to try searching again. Maybe I used better keywords, because I came across a couple useful posts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://lists.geany.org/pipermail/users/2012-October/008346.html"&gt;http://lists.geany.org/pipermail/users/2012-October/008346.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://superuser.com/questions/344441/less-syntax-highlighting-in-geany"&gt;http://superuser.com/questions/344441/less-syntax-highlighting-in-geany&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to look over those posts, but here's what I did:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am using Geany 1.23.1, which is the current version in the Arch Linux repositories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copy a couple of configuration files into your user configuration directory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cp /usr/share/geany/filetype_extensions.conf /home/aaronyoung/.config/geany/filetype_extensions.conf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cp /usr/share/geany/filetypes.css /home/aaronyoung/.config/geany/filedefs/filetypes.css&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit the first file: &lt;strong&gt;~/.config/geany/filetype_extensions.conf&lt;/strong&gt;. Add the SCSS file extension to the CSS line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;CSS=*.css;*.scss;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit the second file: &lt;strong&gt;~/.config/geany/filedefs/filetypes.css&lt;/strong&gt;. I added this at the top of that file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;[lexer_properties]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;lexer.css.scss.language&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Geany is all set up to highlight your SCSS. However, if you've already tried to open a SCSS file in Geany, it has probably cached the filetype with the old configuration. So open &lt;strong&gt;~/.config/geany/geany.conf&lt;/strong&gt; and delete the entire &lt;code&gt;[files]&lt;/code&gt; section at the bottom. Restart Geany - now it should work fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then find yourself a nice colorscheme. Here's a couple good places to check:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/codebrainz/geany-themes"&gt;https://github.com/codebrainz/geany-themes&lt;/a&gt; - a collection of Geany colorschemes&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

This first post will be pretty general and hopefully I can be a little more specific next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Web&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm currently plugging away on several WordPress-based websites, as usual. I'm pretty happy with some of the work that's going to be going live soon and I'm in the middle of a freelance project that I'm pretty excited about. I love working with WordPress, but I'm understanding that it's not always the best solution and I'm looking into a few alternatives as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't consider myself a natural designer, so I try hard to look at great design and figure out what they're doing. &lt;a href="http://unmatchedstyle.com/"&gt;Unmatched Style&lt;/a&gt; is an interesting blog that showcases great design with some good commentary. I would prefer to go in a more minimalist design route, but ultimately in some cases the client wouldn't prefer that style (or it wouldn't be right for their website). Staying detail-oriented and not over-designing is the key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Front End&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm currently rocking SCSS for EVERY project. Preprocessing CSS makes everything easier and better. This has led me to Zurb's &lt;a href="http://foundation.zurb.com"&gt;Foundation&lt;/a&gt; framework, which I'm using on my current projects. I like Foundation and it provides a lot of good starter styles and javascript plugins, but some of it is more than I need. In the interest of keeping things leaner and more manageable locally, I'm considering pruning things down quite a bit. Foundation is not seeming quite as modular as I'd really prefer, so I may build my own assets for a skeleton-style front-end framework, borrowing styles from here and there. The Codrops &lt;a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/category/blueprints/"&gt;Blueprints&lt;/a&gt; elements look really interesting to me as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to do more work in Javascript. I do a lot of code snippets in jQuery as well as some more advanced AJAXy stuff, but if I'm interested in building more interactive / engaging interfaces, I'll need to brush up on my plain JS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Back End&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been realizing lately that I'm more frontend-y than I'd prefer. Time to get back into some back-end programming. While I do some PHP to add functionality to WordPress themes, I'd like to work on more standalone stuff. PHP is an obvious choice because it's widely used, but I'm intrigued by a couple other languages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python is a nice and clean, well-supported language. It has obvious uses both on desktop and web.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node.js is pretty young, but can do some amazing stuff. Meteor.js looks like a great framework for Node. It's very interesting to be able to write Javascript for both client and server using the same API's, and the realtime possibilites are exciting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll need to just choose something and do it. Probably working on Javascript would have the most payoff in the future because of the frontend and backend applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Personal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pretty out of shape, but was able to complete my first triathlon during this month. My main claim to fame is that I had the second best bike -&amp;gt; run transition in the race. My swim leg was surprisingly not awful. I'd like to get in shape for a multi-day bike tour in Central / SE Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if I'll have time to do that. My days are busy and I have to get work done when I can. A lot of interruptions come up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's where things are at the moment. Hopefully I'll have a better report next time around - stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="news"></category><category term="personal"></category></entry><entry><title>Access XAMPP from Other Devices</title><link href="http://ajy.co/web/access-xampp-from-other-devices" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-03-06T17:10:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Aaron James Young</name></author><id>tag:ajy.co,2013-03-06:web/access-xampp-from-other-devices</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've tweaked my web development environment over the last couple days so I can access my local Wordpress websites from other machines on my network. These may include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other computers running different operating systems / browsers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phones or tablets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtualbox guest OS's running on my computer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How I'm doing this&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find your local IP address. Mine is 10.1.10.100. You can find this using a command like &lt;code&gt;ifconfig&lt;/code&gt; for Linux.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up XAMPP, MAMP, WAMP, LAMP, or whatever on your computer. I should point out that I'm using XAMPP on Arch Linux, and I can't guarantee another setup would work like this. If you try this, please leave a comment with your results!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install Wordpress. I use a Wordpress multi-site ("network") installation to keep things a little more streamlined - when I start a new project, I don't always need to create a new database for it, etc. It all depends on the project, but for normal theme development, this setup works fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As you install Wordpress, install it under your local IP address (&lt;a href="http://10.1.10.100"&gt;http://10.1.10.100&lt;/a&gt;) instead of &lt;a href="http://localhost/"&gt;http://localhost/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Wordpress is up, you'll view it at (for example) &lt;a href="http://10.1.10.100/wordpress"&gt;http://10.1.10.100/wordpress&lt;/a&gt;. You can use this same address to access it from any other device on your network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Drawbacks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest drawback is that this setup requires your local IP address always to be the same. If you take your computer to another network, you'll probably be assigned a different IP address, and there's not much you can do about this. Your Wordpress install won't particularly work, especially if you try to get past the home page. And changing the site URL is not really a quick and easy task when you account for media URLs and permalink-related issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, I settled on a "good enough" solution. The benefits of this setup, especially with using &lt;a href="http://modern.ie"&gt;Modern IE&lt;/a&gt; in Virtualbox, clearly outweigh the drawbacks for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went in to my office and checked which local IP had been assigned to my machine. It was the one I mentioned above - 10.1.10.100. So then I came home, configured my router to serve address in the 10.1.10.xxx range, and assigned my computer the 10.1.10.100 IP address. So I have a working development environment both at home and at the office, which is good enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="linux"></category><category term="code"></category></entry><entry><title>AutoCorrect common misspellings in WordPress</title><link href="http://ajy.co/web/autocorrect-common-misspellings-in-wordpress" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-02-15T21:21:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Aaron James Young</name></author><id>tag:ajy.co,2013-02-15:web/autocorrect-common-misspellings-in-wordpress</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the minor features that got some press when WordPress 3 came out was that "Wordpress" is now automatically corrected to "WordPress" throughout your website - in post or page content, titles, and in comments. This is in an attempt to maintain consistent branding throughout the product, although some consider it &lt;a href="http://capitalp.org/"&gt;slightly more nefarious&lt;/a&gt;. Whatever your opinion, this idea can be handy when building client websites, for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, one of my current website design clients is a business with a name much like WordPress - a combination of two common words, and they prefer to capitalize the second word. I wanted to make it easy for them to write the word correctly on their site; so I took a look at WordPress' code for doing this autocorrect, and adapted it for my needs. Here you go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;// place in your theme&amp;#39;s functions.php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;// replace &amp;quot;Myword&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;MyWord&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;foreach ( array( &amp;#39;the_content&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;the_title&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;comment_text&amp;#39; ) as $filter ) {&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;    add_filter( $filter, &amp;#39;capital_W_dangit&amp;#39; );&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;function capital_W_dangit( $text ) {&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;    return str_replace( &amp;#39;Myword&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;MyWord&amp;#39;, $text );&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What does it do? Simple. It gets the text from the page content, title, and comments - and corrects the spelling of "Myword" to "MyWord". You can set this up to do any search and replace in WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd also like to note that my function name "capital_W_dangit" is chosen here simply because the original (WordPress) function is called "capital_P_dangit". You're not likely to run into conflicts with this naming scheme, but you might be best off namespacing your function names as a matter of habit.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="wordpress"></category><category term="tweaks"></category><category term="code"></category></entry><entry><title>Fade to background image in CSS</title><link href="http://ajy.co/web/fade-to-background-image-in-css" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-01-24T21:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Aaron James Young</name></author><id>tag:ajy.co,2013-01-24:web/fade-to-background-image-in-css</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;(As an aside: I'm not sure this is the best title for this piece. Please feel free to suggest one that will be more useful to search visitors!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting things I decided to do with my latest website redesign is a little fade effect as you scroll down the page. The dark gray website header stays fixed at the top of your browser, and content appears to fade out as you scroll down. &lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Works in Webkit desktop browsers only (Chrome and Safari are the big names here).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are using an unsupported browser and don't see the effect live on this page, check the image above to see what I'm talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen this effect a number of times, but usually it's placed against a solid-color background. Essentially, you can use a pseudo-element (:before or :after) in CSS and apply a gradient background; or put a box shadow on the element above, and slide the content underneath that to make it look like it's fading out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example with a blue box-shadow so you can see what's going on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://ajy.co/images/2013/fade-blue.png" alt="blue shadow" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example with light gray box-shadow: see how the content is sliding underneath the shadow, but appears to fade out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://ajy.co/images/2013/fade-gray.png" alt="gray shadow" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this with a gradient image or a CSS box-shadow, the background needs to be the same solid color as the shadow you're using to cover the content. So you generally don't find this effect against an image background - you would be able to see the shadow no matter what color it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on my website, I'm using this basic technique but there are a few special conditions here. In brief:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The content is indeed scrolling underneath a pseudo-element (footer.body:before)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The background of that pseudo-element is the same background image that is used on the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag itself. The element actually covers up the entire browser window, so the image will be displayed exactly the same size as it is on &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pseudo-element has a Webkit mask image applied to it, which makes it mostly transparent except for the gradient area directly underneath the header.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have also applied &lt;code&gt;pointer-events: none;&lt;/code&gt; to the pseudo element so you can click the links, select text, etc. that is underneath it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, here you go in more depth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; of my website has a background image applied like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sx"&gt;url(&amp;#39;path-to-image.jpg&amp;#39;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;no-repeat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;fixed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* fixed, centered image */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cover&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* image covers the browser window w/out being stretched out of proportion */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I have a pseudo-element on my footer that covers the entire window. Then if I use the same background image again, it will be exactly overlaid over the body background. Also, since the pseudo-element covers the window, let's make sure that mouse events are passed through to the content below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;footer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;fixed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* covers entire window */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sx"&gt;url(&amp;#39;path-to-image.jpg&amp;#39;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;no-repeat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;fixed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* fixed, centered image */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cover&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* image covers the browser window w/out being stretched out of proportion */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;pointer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;events&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* pass clicks, hovers, etc. down to content stacked below this element */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;/* ... (more coming here in the next step) */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Next, I'm going to use a mask image on that pseudo-element with the -webkit-mask property that only works in Webkit browsers. This requires me to take a little side trip to explain CSS mask images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;footer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;/* ... stuff from previous step ... */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;webkit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sx"&gt;url(&amp;#39;path/to/masker.png&amp;#39;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;webkit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;repeat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;repeat-x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;webkit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;WebKit allows you to set a mask image on an element. The image itself will not display - rather it will appear to clip the element it is masking. Transparent areas of the image will block or clip the element; non-transparent areas of the masking image will allow the element to show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://ajy.co/images/2013/heartmasking.png" alt="heart masking" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's use a concrete example: a div with a red background, and an image of a black heart. Applying this image as a mask will result in a red heart appearing on the page. The transparent areas of the image hide the red background and the non-transparent heart area of the image will allow the red area to show through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Demo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a demo of the effect. Feel free to play with it to see what's going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="codepen" data-height="300" data-type="result" data-href="xseKz" data-user="aaronjamesyoung" data-safe="true"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;a href="http://codepen.io/aaronjamesyoung/pen/xseKz"&gt;Check out this Pen!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;script async src="http://codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Webkit desktop browsers only&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me break this down. This doesn't work for everyone, so I have to be careful about how I implement it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My footer.body:before only displays in Webkit browsers. It covers the entire browser window, and I don't want it to display in other browsers because the mask image only works in Webkit. I've added a "masking" class to &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with a Modernizr-like Javascript snippet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Touch devices don't handle fixed background images and fixed position elements the same way that desktop browsers do. So I have used Modernizr to detect touch devices, and I don't display the footer.body:before element on those devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both these cases, I have acceptable fallbacks in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this is a fun, not-too-useful little trick. Hope you enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="css"></category><category term="experiment"></category><category term="code"></category></entry><entry><title>Zim Desktop Wiki: More than taking notes, Part 2</title><link href="http://ajy.co/linux/zim-desktop-wiki-more-than-taking-notes-part-2" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-01-14T17:01:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Aaron James Young</name></author><id>tag:ajy.co,2013-01-14:linux/zim-desktop-wiki-more-than-taking-notes-part-2</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome back! This post will wrap up this two-part series on the Zim Desktop Wiki personal notetaking program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In part 1, I discussed the basics of using Zim and highlighted some useful plugins that ship with Zim by default. In part 2, I will write about some useful, but not-so-obvious, features of the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: View &lt;a href="http://ajy.co/linux/zim-desktop-wiki-more-than-taking-notes-part-1/"&gt;Part 1 of this Zim series&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Digging deeper: Zim behind the scenes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've mentioned Zim being a great tool for writing. It's simple formatting options and it's overall speediness and responsiveness make it a great place to write all your notes, documents, outlines, and other material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Zim can also be a great tool for &lt;em&gt;collecting&lt;/em&gt; data, whether you're at your computer or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in Part 1, Zim stores its data in plain text files on your computer. These files contain wiki-formatted text that is easy to read and work with. This is an advantage for a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can open your notes in another program (a text editor), make a few changes, and save the file. You'll see those changes next time you open Zim.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can put your Zim notebook in your Dropbox folder. This allows you to sync your notes seamlessly between various devices. I dual-boot Linux and Windows, and I have Zim installed in both operating systems and using the same notebook that is in Dropbox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can open your Zim notes in a text editor from the Dropbox app on your phone or tablet for quick reference/editing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Automatically insert data into your Zim notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://ajy.co/images/2013/zim-2-1.png" alt="IFTTT Phone channel" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my Zim notes in Dropbox, I can use &lt;a href="http://ifttt.com"&gt;IFTTT&lt;/a&gt; (If This Then That) to insert data into my Zim notebook. IFTTT acts as "glue" between several different web services and has the ability to take data from one service, and write some text in a file in your Dropbox folder. Here are some ways I leverage that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can call a IFTTT-provided phone number with my cellphone, leave a voicemail, and it will be transcribed and added in to my Zim notes with a link to the MP3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I back up all my &lt;a href="http://delicious.com/aaronjamesyoung"&gt;Delicious&lt;/a&gt; links, Tweets and Facebook statuses to Zim automatically, also with IFTTT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I make online purchases and get an email reciept, I label it "Reciepts" in Gmail and it is automatically backed up in my Zim notebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many other potential uses of IFTTT and Zim. The only limit is yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A few more tricks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://ajy.co/images/2013/zim-2-2.png" alt="Quick Note" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I save all my screenshots and scans into my Zim notebook (somewhat automatically; they are saved in the "attachment folder" for the notes).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use the Quick Note plugin (pictured above) to save articles to read for later, code snippets, and other information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zim allows exporting notes to many different formats, including HTML and Markdown. This means I can save my Zim Links page to HTML and store it in Dropbox. I use it as my web browser "home page" to have quick access to all my bookmarks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of Markdown export, I can write this blog post in Zim, export to Markdown, and use it as a new blog post in my new Pelican-based blog (which converts Markdown files to HTML).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notebooks can be shared and synced with others over Dropbox (in practice, there are a couple limitations to this, notably that you can't work on the same notes at the same time).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My intent is not really to turn this post into a list of ways that I use Zim - but instead to highlight the flexibility you get when your data is stored in plain text and accessible to other programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Digging - yes - even deeper: Development of Zim&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zim is an actively developed program that sees minor releases every few months. These releases generally fix a few bugs and add a few new features. For example, the 0.58 release added the "Distraction Free" fullscreen writing mode I mentioned in the last post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project leader is responsive and open to suggestions. If you suggest a new feature for Zim (and can prove its usefulness) there's a good chance you'll get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To wrap up, I hope that this little series helps you get started with Zim, and I hope that Zim helps to improve your workflow. Here are a couple more reference links for you:&lt;/p&gt;

This little program is probably my favorite app on my computer, and I'd like to provide a quick review / intro to Zim in this post. I use Zim for writing web design project notes, blog posts such as this one, Todo lists, documents, and for collecting information from all over. Zim is an excellent cross between Evernote and simpler programs like Notational Velocity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this two-part series, I'll discuss usage and functionality of Zim. This first post will deal with the "nuts and bolts" while the second part will get into some more advanced "fringe" uses of Zim that are possible because of the way Zim is built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: View &lt;a href="http://ajy.co/linux/zim-desktop-wiki-more-than-taking-notes-part-2/"&gt;Part 2 of this Zim series&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Zim on the Surface: Advanced Notetaking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://ajy.co/images/2013/zim-1.jpg" class="alignleft" alt="Zim Screenshot" /&gt;At its core, Zim is basically a notetaking program with some advanced capabilities. Notes are stored on your computer in plain text format and are saved as you type. You can insert images and links to other files on your computer, and you can directly edit those plain text files if you wish. The text files contain wiki-formatted text that is easy to read while retaining some formatting cues (similar to Markdown text).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zim allows for some basic formatting options such as bulleted and numbered lists; bold, italic, and underlined text, headings and paragraphs, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Wiki, Zim allows you to easily link between pages of your notebook and can even auto-link text as you type it (for example, type :Projects:Project1 - it will automatically create the page "Projects" in your notebook, with a subpage "Project1", and the text will automatically link to that page).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this level, you could think of Zim as a more featured version of Notational Velocity or a similar app. Of course, NV features syncing - I'll get to that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be referring to the Zim website and documentation throughout this post, so this is a good time to start. See the &lt;a href="http://zim-wiki.org"&gt;Zim home page&lt;/a&gt;, which describes the basic idea of Zim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to start using Zim&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linux: Install zim from your package manager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows: Get the latest Zim installer from here: &lt;a href="http://www.glump.net/software/zim"&gt;http://www.glump.net/software/zim&lt;/a&gt; (note that at this time, even though Zim 0.58 is out, the latest Windows installer is 0.57)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mac OSX: See this page: &lt;a href="http://zim-wiki.org/install.html"&gt;http://zim-wiki.org/install.html&lt;/a&gt; - it appears that installation on OSX is not very straightforward. This is a shame as I feel this app would fit in really well for a lot of Mac users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After installing, open Zim. It will ask you to specify a folder to hold your notes (Pro tip: Put them in a Dropbox subfolder! More on this later). Once you have created your notebook, Zim will open up with a fairly sparse window. Now you can start to write notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write your notes. As you type, you can type the name of a new page (starting with a :colon as above) and Zim will automatically create that page. Or, right-click in the side pane and make a new page or subpage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start a line with "* " (asterisk - space) and the asterisk will get converted to a bullet point. You're now working in a bulleted list! Hit enter twice to get out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start a line with "[] " (two square brackets, then a space) and the brackets will be converted to an empty checkbox. Now you're writing a todo-list item. Click the checkbox to mark it done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zim has a few little tricks like this. Start working with it and you'll eventually find more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Just below the surface: Plugins and advanced features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, you can write notes all the time with Zim, but you might like to check the Edit-&amp;gt;Preferences menu item and see what is available to you. Look through the options (there aren't too many), but in particular, check the "Plugins" tab. I'll highlight a few of these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distraction Free Editing - enable this and hit F11 for a fullscreen distraction-free document editor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insert Screenshot - choose a menu item to take a screenshot and automatically insert that into your note&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Journal - this used to be named "Calendar". Essentially it adds a Calendar to your notebook and allows you to create a page per day simply by clicking on a date of the calendar. Great for, well, journaling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Line sorter - making a list (like this list)? Select a bunch of lines in your note and choose "Sort Lines" - they will be sorted alphabetically (good for shopping lists?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quick Note - Lets you pop up a "Quick Note" window that will automatically insert text into one of your notes. Here's how I use it: I am reading a blog post on the web, and I see some code or information I want to remember. I select it with my mouse to highlight it, then I hit a keyboard shortcut on my computer to open the Quick Note window. The Quick Note opens with my selected text already entered in - I hit "OK" and that text is added to the end of an "Inbox" note in my notebook. From there, I file it as appropriate later on. I use this a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tags - allows you to use @tags in your notes and provides a tag filtering function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Task List - manage your todos, dates, and priorities in Zim&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Version Control - integrates with git or other version control systems. You can roll back your Zim notebook to an earlier version if you need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zim has a good search functionality built in as well. There is a Search menu, or you can just hit Control + Shift + F to search your entire notebook for some word. This, along with tags and the hierarchical note structure, makes it pretty easy to find what you're looking for. Zim also has keyboard shortcuts built in for many different functions to help speed up your writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this piques your interest in this little program. At this level, I use Zim to take meeting notes, web design project notes, outline and write blog posts and documents, keep code snippets that I can copy/paste, keep a list of web bookmarks, and track other reminders and notes for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zim is a powerful and flexible program, and this post just scratches the surface of its capabilities. Keep an eye out for &lt;a href="http://ajy.co/linux/zim-desktop-wiki-more-than-taking-notes-part-2/"&gt;Part 2 of this series&lt;/a&gt; coming soon, where I'll dig deeper and discuss more advanced usage of Zim.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>New site and 2013 Goals</title><link href="http://ajy.co/web/new-site-and-2013-goals" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-01-05T20:37:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Aaron James Young</name></author><id>tag:ajy.co,2013-01-05:web/new-site-and-2013-goals</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the new and improved AJY.co! This is the time of year that one redesigns one's website and ponders the year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's coming up in 2013?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2012 was a very busy year for me. You may know that I'm the Design Director for &lt;a href="http://opt-e-web.com"&gt;Opt(e)Web&lt;/a&gt;, a small tech company here in Salem, Oregon. Business ramped up steadily throughout the year and we have been challenged to improve our approach to project management and client communication. We've made huge strides and I'm working more efficiently than I ever have. But there's a lot going on, and it doesn't leave me much time for self-improvement, networking, and sometimes a personal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a professional perspective, 2013 is a year of focusing on the improvements I need to make. I'm hoping that my blogging here and over at the Opt(e)Web site can spur me to improve my networking with other web professionals in our area and beyond. So you should expect to see frequent, if not regular, updates on both websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href="http://opt-e-web.com"&gt;http://opt-e-web.com&lt;/a&gt; I will be posting web-related subjects and tips that I encounter in my day-to-day work life. These tips will be focused on one of two audiences: either our customers who, in some cases, may not be particularly web-savvy; or our colleagues in this industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here on this site I will be posting about a wider range of subjects that might interest me. I hope to write about web-related topics as well as Linux and software topics (I'm kind of a Linux hobbyist). Finally, I'll post personal-related blog posts from time to time. FYI, I do have category-specific RSS/Atom feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Also coming up in 2013&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am hoping to get back on the bike and in great shape. Time will tell if I'm able to work it into my regular schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to cook more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to continue getting better at project management and working efficiently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to network better in the web industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to help/mentor an up-and-coming web designer/developer in the area. At this point I don't have time for a full-fledged mentoring program, but occasional coffee meetings would be great.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About my new website design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to go bulleted-list style on this section as well. I plan on writing about many of these features in future blog posts, so I'll just mention them here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most significant change to my website is actually under the hood. I have switched from Wordpress to &lt;a href="http://getpelican.com"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;, a static blogging engine. Basically, I have a folder full of &lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/"&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; files on my computer. Each text file is a post or page of my website; when I write a new post, I run Pelican and it regenerates my site. It creates static HTML files, so my website should be pretty fast since there's no database involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New design, of course. Make my logo and name smaller, people aren't here to stare at them. Use more cutting-edge technologies - the logo is SVG, for example.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is kind of fun. Notice that if you scroll down, the header stays fixed at the top of the page. The content section of the website fades to the background photo just under the header. This is a trick I'll definitely write about soon, because I haven't seen anything quite like this elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, if you scroll down, try clicking on a blank spot in the dark gray header. It'll scoot you right back up to the top of the page. This was just a little tricky and I'll write about it later as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've dropped about 3/4 of the posts from my old website. I've kept posts that I think may be relevant or posts that have been attracting a decent amount of traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still to do: I'm getting a website search function going pretty soon. You'll see it at the top of the right sidebar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Come along for 2013!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a lot to do! If any of the blog topics that I mentioned seem interested (or if you feel like it) I'd love to have you subscribe or get in touch:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://opt-e-web.com"&gt;Opt(e)Web&lt;/a&gt; clients to review. The design uses a somewhat
unconventional layout, but it has some interesting possibilities for
this client, and I think it has the potential to be visually engaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I'm not sure the client likes it that well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The layout, as I said, is a little different.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think the client is having difficulty imagining their information
    in the mockup I gave them; this may partly be my fault&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There may be a few "little things" that are getting in the way: the
    client may not like a particular placeholder image I chose, or they
    may want some different colors here and there. This ALWAYS happens
    with every project; I don't think any good designer can deliver the
    &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; product on the first round.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web design process has a lot of challenges, and designing for
clients is difficult for many reasons. I usually have an incomplete
understanding of my clients' businesses and their personal aesthetic
tastes don't always match mine. A big part of the job is getting inside
my clients' heads. It's not enough to build a site that looks like their
business card - instead, I have to craft a design that will meet their
business needs, represent who they are, and present (usually) a lot of
information in a way that is informative and useful to website users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I try something new - such as this website layout - I have to
make sure it will work for the client. Sometimes I guess wrong. I'm
still holding out hope for the design in this situation, albeit with
some modifications. And, as usual, there's something to learn from this
project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What can I do differently?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should have filled the mockup (it's a coded site) with information and
pictures that relate to the client's site. Even though I don't have any
of their actual content yet, I should have take more time to find some
related text and photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe in this case, I ought to have called the client instead of sending
an email with the mockup link. That's a really tough call, since you
have to know how best to communicate with specific clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I talk to the client, I'll try to talk up the possibilities and
potential I see in the design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's important to remember not to get too personally invested in a
design concept. It's not my design; it's my client's design.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="clients"></category><category term="strategy"></category><category term="personal"></category></entry><entry><title>The best coffee in Salem, Oregon</title><link href="http://ajy.co/personal/the-best-coffee-in-salem-oregon" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-09-26T14:23:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Aaron James Young</name></author><id>tag:ajy.co,2012-09-26:personal/the-best-coffee-in-salem-oregon</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It may be surprising, but we have a surprisingly good selection of
coffee here in Salem, Oregon. We have several quality coffee shops and
some great roasters in town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a few months now, we have been getting our coffee from Joseph Penner
at Steel Bridge Coffee - and it's the best coffee we've come across
here, for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steel Bridge is a completely &lt;a href="http://steelbridgecoffee.com"&gt;local coffee roasting company in Salem, Oregon&lt;/a&gt;. Joseph even roasts on a roaster built in Oregon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bicycle Delivery. Our coffee shows up every Tuesday afternoon on our
    doorstep in a jar and it's delivered by bicycle. How awesome is
    that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As you know, the best coffee comes from the freshest beans. Joseph
    puts it best on his website: &lt;em&gt;"We bicycle-deliver whole bean coffee
    to your doorstep on the day that it was roasted (RAIN or SHINE)."&lt;/em&gt;
    Try finding coffee that fresh anyplace else in town.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quality roasting. Joseph is a student of the craft and writes in
    detail about his &lt;a href="http://www.steelbridgecoffee.com/blog.html"&gt;coffee roasting experiences&lt;/a&gt; on his website. He
    buys and roasts coffee from various places around the world and is
    attentive to the differences  in coffee from region to region. He
    enjoys educating his customers about coffee as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cost: I can go to the grocery store and get a bag of coffee roasted
    three months ago if I'm lucky. Or I can get fresh roasted coffee
    delivered for almost the same price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph delivers whole bean coffee only. You'll need a grinder. If you
just use a drip machine, a blade grinder is adequate. But for more
flexibility (a French press is a great way to make coffee) you'll
definitely prefer spending a little extra on a decent burr grinder. A
burr grinder produces a much more even grind and I wouldn't use a French
press without it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you're in Salem, Oregon and you're trying to find the &lt;a href="http://steelbridgecoffee.com"&gt;best
coffee&lt;/a&gt; you can get in
your home or business, check out Steel Bridge Coffee and give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="coffee"></category><category term="coffee"></category><category term="delicious"></category></entry><entry><title>Huge Trees and You: How to live in a giant tree</title><link href="http://ajy.co/web/huge-trees-and-you-how-to-live-in-a-giant-tree" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-08-10T12:21:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Aaron James Young</name></author><id>tag:ajy.co,2012-08-10:web/huge-trees-and-you-how-to-live-in-a-giant-tree</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a website for people who live in gigantic trees.

I've been planning it for some time, but inertia is strong. The final
straw came today when I found out GoDaddy is supporting the SOPA act.
But that's not what this post is about. One of my domains from early on
had "Private Registration", meaning that WHOIS info is not displayed for
that domain (I've since decided I don't really care about that). GoDaddy
manages their Private Registration through a sister/child/whatever
company called "Domains By Proxy".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To transfer my domain, I need to remove private registration. To remove
private registration, I need to log in to my Domains By Proxy account.
Whenever I purchase private registration through Godaddy, it's supposed
to send me a customer number for Domains by Proxy (note the wording
there). So to log in to Domains By Proxy, I have to find an email from
GoDaddy with my customer number. I found (via online search) that the
password is the same as my GoDaddy password. Then I log on to Domains By
Proxy, remove private registration, unlock my domain in Godaddy, and get
the transfer authorization code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the emails I have on record from GoDaddy contain any mention of
my Domains By Proxy login information. I've seen other accounts where
people haven't received their information either. I don't believe I have
deleted these emails, I am generally good about keeping them. I'm pretty
sure I never received them. I tried logging on to Domains By Proxy with
my GoDaddy login info, and that did not work. I also tried to retrieve
my DBP customer number by going through the "forgotten my login
information" form. But it didn't work, which was my fault-- I had
originally registered the domain with an old email address that no
longer exists. So I presume that DBP was trying to send info to that
email address. At this point I was getting a little discouraged and was
about to fill out the huge form at Domains By Proxy that requires me to
prove my identity by faxing them a copy of my drivers license and
requires a three-day waiting period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, I found a search result that gave me the following tip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the GoDaddy product overview page, select another domain name and
    start the process to add Private Registration to it (click "Add" in
    the Private Registration column for a domain that doesn't have it).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the modal window that pops up, near the bottom is a prompt that
    says "Select your Domains By Proxy account"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There should be a choice that contains your customer number (8-ish
    digits). Use that customer number to log on to Domains By Proxy, and
    use your GoDaddy password. Go crazy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</summary><category term="privacy"></category><category term="domain"></category></entry><entry><title>Want a free TV?</title><link href="http://ajy.co/personal/want-a-free-tv" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-12-20T16:59:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Aaron James Young</name></author><id>tag:ajy.co,2011-12-20:personal/want-a-free-tv</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit: The TV is spoken for already. It took less than 10 minutes. That
was quick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're going TV-free - and to celebrate, we're giving away a free TV (you
see what I did there?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably don't want this. It's not new, light, or sleek. It's one
more thing to use up space in your room and time in your life.
Hopefully, there's someone around you who is more important to you than
watching another sitcom on a standard-def, 27-inch CRT. Heck, in order
to even get over-the-air reception, you'll need to get one of those
analog-to-digital converter boxes. And an antenna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully all this kind of explains why we're getting rid of it. To boil
it down, we just don't need it. We'd rather spend time with the baby and
each other. We don't particularly use it except for sports and
(sometimes) news, and those can be done on the computer if we need. At
some point we'll need to figure out how to handle the Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we're really giving it away, but you'll need to act quickly if you do
want it (for whatever reason). Otherwise we'll be taking it to Goodwill
within the next couple days.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="free"></category></entry><entry><title>Protecting your personal privacy and reputation with social media</title><link href="http://ajy.co/web/protecting-your-personal-privacy-and-reputation-with-social-media" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-12-08T11:05:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Aaron James Young</name></author><id>tag:ajy.co,2011-12-08:web/protecting-your-personal-privacy-and-reputation-with-social-media</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Personal privacy online is a hot topic in today's social media world.
Facebook's privacy settings are notoriously complicated and constantly
changing. Google Plus and Twitter use simpler - but radically different
- paradigms for user privacy, and location-based networks such as
Foursquare introduce other privacy concerns. Reputation management is
closely tied in with privacy as well; suppose that a Facebook friend
tags you in a potentially incriminating photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the complexity of trying to manage "who can see what",
especially on multiple social networks, I personally favor a "keep it
simple" approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post everything publicly; and assume everything you post is public.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does this mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Choose carefully what you post online, and post it publicly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://ajy.co/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Selection_019.png" title="Selection_019" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only post a status, photo, or video if you're OK with the whole world
seeing it.&lt;/strong&gt; If you're not OK with that, don't post it. Remember that
anything you post CAN BE directly or indirectly shared with the whole
world. Might as well put it out there to start with, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever you choose to post can (and likely will) be viewed in a job
search, by a co-worker or boss, pastor, potential date, parents, family,
and more. It's a no-brainer that you need to think about what you post
instead of relying on Facebook to protect it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, when I post publicly, it removes the temptation to post
something that could be harmful or hurtful if it gets out. For example,
I'd love to post horror stories about some of my web design clients. But
that's professionally a bad idea and the story could make its way to
those people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have something private to discuss with another person, Twitter &amp;amp;
Facebook both have good private-messaging systems. Email and the phone
work too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also:&lt;/strong&gt; Check over your Facebook profile. Is your phone number shared
publicly, or just with friends? What's your current job, and who can see
that? Most of the Facebook setttings are "Friends", "Friends of
Friends", or "Everyone". Choose carefully - but remember that even if
you put restricted settings on some parts of your profile, they can
still get out there if someone shares them. Are you OK with that? If
not, take it down and hope nobody has already shared it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Try to control what other people can say about you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now what you're all waiting for - actually digging into Facebook's
privacy settings. Click the little triangle at the top right of your
Facebook page and choose "Privacy Settings". Make sure - like above -
your default status is "public".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;"How you Connect" and "How Tags Work"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are my settings for these sections (click each to enlarge):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ajy.co/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Selection_020.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Facebook settings" src="http://ajy.co/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Selection_020-444x264.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ajy.co/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Selection_021.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="How Tags Work" src="http://ajy.co/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Selection_021-444x253.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the idea here is that anything I post is public (that
is, filtered before I post it). Then, I restrict others from tagging me
in photos, checking me in to places (even if I'm not there), etc. - so
it reduces the risk that someone can negatively impact my reputation in
this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kudos to Facebook for seriously revamping this interface - but it's
still needlessly complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also:&lt;/strong&gt; Be careful of approving Facebook apps since they can access
and share your information. I got an app request the other day for some
birthday calendar thing. Uh, no thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Privacy is your responsibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't rely on Facebook, Twitter, or Google+ to protect your privacy.
Anyone can share your information from those sites with the whole world
- and we haven't even mentioned what these large companies may do with
your data. Did you know that all public tweets are archived in the
Library of Congress?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always assume anything that goes online is out of my control -
therefore, I need to control it before it gets there. Posting my status
publicly helps me to do that and it puts me in the right mindset when I
hit that "Post" button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have anything to add? Write a comment! Of course, remember,
everyone can see it!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="strategy"></category><category term="privacy"></category></entry><entry><title>Linux Apps I use</title><link href="http://ajy.co/linux/linux-apps-i-use" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-07-30T13:12:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Aaron James Young</name></author><id>tag:ajy.co,2011-07-30:linux/linux-apps-i-use</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been running a couple different flavors of Linux for the last
four-plus years. I am currently on Arch Linux. I like to experiment with
different programs that fit my current workflow, or can improve my
workflow in some way. So here's my current Arch Linux setup (all links
below open in new tab):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Window Manger / Desktop Environment:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://subforge.org/projects/subtle/wiki"&gt;Subtle Window Manager&lt;/a&gt; - Manual tiling window manager with a
    twist. Open a window, and it appears in the center of your screen.
    Hit &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Windows key&amp;gt; + &amp;lt;Keypad 7&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to move the window to the top
    left corner of the screen (see where the "7" is on your keypad?).
    Hit &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Windows key&amp;gt; + &amp;lt;Keypad 2&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to move the window to the bottom
    of the screen and stretch it full width. That's the basic idea of
    Subtle, although there are some other features as well. I like it
    because it's both keyboard- and mouse-friendly, and I can arrange
    windows exactly the way I want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://clipit.rspwn.com/"&gt;Clipit&lt;/a&gt; - A clipboard manager that keeps track of text I select
    and copy. Little utility but incredibly useful. Also, Linux is nice
    because you can temporarily copy text by simply selecting it, and
    paste with a middle-click (technically, this is a feature of the X
    window system)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I set my GTK and icon theme with
    LXAppearance, my background with Nitrogen, and my panel is built in
    to Subtle. I like having a launch bar, it's handy and fits my
    workflow. I use Adeskbar for this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Terminal Apps:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://roxterm.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Roxterm&lt;/a&gt; - easy-to-configure, lightweight VTE terminal without
    Gnome dependencies. I'd use Gnome-terminal if I was running Gnome,
    but I'm not. Same goes for XFCE Terminal. I like urxvt but for me,
    it's always more of a pain to configure than it's worth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://ranger.nongnu.org/"&gt;Ranger&lt;/a&gt; - Really a nice column-based, Finder-like file manager
    that uses Vim-ish keybindings. Kind of a pain to configure, but I
    did it once and am keeping my config files from now on. Works best
    if you install "atool", which is kind of a
    meta-compression-decompression utility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://moc.daper.net/"&gt;moc&lt;/a&gt; - a music player that pretty much just works. Awesome and
    super lightweight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://6xq.net/projects/pianobar/"&gt;pianobar&lt;/a&gt; - Pandora.com music streamer. Much nicer than Pandora's
    Flash player, but Pandora is revamping their website. Still, this
    has to be better than having another tab open in your web browser.
    There's also a GTK pianobar client called "Pithos".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.coderholic.com/pyradio/"&gt;pyradio&lt;/a&gt; - Internet radio streaming. It's just a single python
    script, and I had to edit it just a little to work in Arch. Requires
    mplayer, which also comes in handy for listening to single audio
    files or watching videos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://tyrs.nicosphere.net/"&gt;tyrs&lt;/a&gt; - a fantastic Twitter client. Currently I'm getting some
    kind of error with it, but that might be something in my
    configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.vim.org/"&gt;vim&lt;/a&gt; - best text editor known to mankind. Incredibly extensible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also: Git, Tig (visualization of Git repository history), pngcrush
    and optipng (PNG compression, I have a script that uses these),
    Wicd-curses (network manager), whois, qalc, scrot (screenshots),
    probably a few others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used in past: Alpine (I absolutely love this email client but it
    just doesn't fit my workflow now, I think. I might need to try it
    again.), Wordgrinder (really basic word processing), Abook (address
    book/contacts), Newsbeuter (RSS reader, I prefer Google Reader),
    Calcurse and wyrd (calendar apps, I prefer wyrd but I need to have
    shareable Google Calendars), ikog (todo-list), hnb (hierarchical
    notebook), cursetheweather (weather report)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Graphical Apps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://zim-wiki.org/"&gt;Zim&lt;/a&gt; - a desktop wiki, which to me really means a super-handy
    note-taking application. This is probably my favorite app that I
    use. Perfect for organizing notes (including images, links, and
    other media) and easily sync'ed with Dropbox. As a plus, it runs on
    Windows also, so I can use Dropbox to sync my notebook and access my
    notes on Windows when I need to work in that environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit"&gt;Komodo Edit&lt;/a&gt; - Another extensible text editor with a liberal dose
    of vim keybindings (optional). Fits my development workflow better
    than Vim. Can keep code snippets as well. For HTML, be sure to
    install the HTML Toolkit extension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/font-manager/"&gt;Font-manager&lt;/a&gt; - great little app for categorizing, browsing,
    enabling, disabling fonts on your system. Does what it says on the
    tin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GIMP (Development version) (no link, of course) - The development
    version of GIMP adds a couple great features: single-window mode
    (especially nice for a tiling window manager) and layer groups. It's
    also quite stable - anecdotally, I have friends who are always
    complaining about Photoshop crashing, and I've only had a couple
    crashes with the development version of GIMP. The stable versions of
    GIMP are always quite good. The only problem I have right now is
    some kind of messed-up antialiasing settings that result in a
    greenish outline on white text. I need to convert text to paths,
    then path to selection, then fill with white to work around this.
    This wasn't a problem for me on Ubuntu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://pwmt.org"&gt;Zathura and Jumanji&lt;/a&gt; - Ever used the Vimperator extension for
    Firefox? Zathura is a PDF viewer and Jumanji is a web browser with
    similar interface to Vimperator. Think - a web browser completely
    controllable with the keyboard, no need ever to visit the mouse.
    Excellent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Others: Firefox, Inkscape, Skype, Dropbox (not really graphical on
    Arch), Filezilla (FTP), Calibre (E-book organizer), Mirage
    (lightweight image viewer), gpick (color scheme editor), Shotwell
    (photo manager), LibreOffice, Shutter (screenshot tool) and more. I
    much prefer lightweight, single-use apps but will use a heavier app
    if it's better or fits my workflow better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Others I've used in the past and liked: Digikam (photo management,
    KDE app), Geany (code editor), Jajuk (ridiculously heavyweight and
    incredibly ugly music player, but some sweet features), Epiphany
    (Gnome webkit browser)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Things I wish for:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easier/better workflow for testing websites in IE 6-9 without having
    to boot Windows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better/any CMYK support in GIMP and Inkscape, and better PSD/AI/EPS
    import and export in these apps. The KDE image viewer Gwenview does
    a decent job opening PSD files, but only for viewing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GIMP "Layer Effects" plugin updated to work in development GIMP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ubuntu Unity overlay scrollbars in Arch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That about does it for me. As I noted, there are obviously other
programs I use, but this takes me through my normal daily workflow.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Baby announcements!</title><link href="http://ajy.co/personal/baby-announcements" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-05-10T07:42:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Aaron James Young</name></author><id>tag:ajy.co,2011-05-10:personal/baby-announcements</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://ajy.co/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/hanna.png" title="hanna" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

got me thinking. When I see things like this, I usually think, "That's a
cool hack, but how will it work on the many different platforms?"
Especially Linux, since I'm a Linux user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For quick reference, here's what he says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;sans-serif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* don&amp;#39;t specify Helvetica or Arial */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Macintosh PC's get Helvetica by default, which is awesome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows PC's get Arial by default, which is good because Helvetica
    doesn't look good on Windows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All others get the browser's default sans-serif font by default&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, Linux is in the "all others" category and there are issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ubuntu (the most used distro) uses the Ubuntu font by default. It's
    a nice font but has a different character, and more importantly,
    different metrics from Helvetica/Arial&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many other distros use DejaVu Sans by default. Also nice (and more
    generic than Ubuntu), but it also has different metrics than
    Helvetica/Arial&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally like Liberation Sans quite a bit. It's a great sans-serif
font that is metrically equivalent to Helvetica and I find it nicer than
Arial. It's installed on many Linux distros by default, so here's a
simple modification that will make things just a little more uniform for
many (not all) Linux users:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Liberation Sans&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;sans-serif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While I haven't tested Liberation Sans on a Mac or Windows machine, MOST
Mac and Windows users aren't likely to have it installed and, like I
say, I prefer it over Arial, so it's OK if they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This still doesn't address mobile devices much, especially if they use
Droid Sans by default (which I find characteristically a little closer
to Trebuchet MS than Helvetica).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last note: I'd personally only do this for body text, where different
fonts aren't likely to break your layout. Menus, headlines, etc - be
more specific about your font choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, those are my thoughts. Cheers.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="code"></category><category term="css"></category><category term="font"></category></entry><entry><title>Stop autosaving and post revisions in Wordpress</title><link href="http://ajy.co/web/stop-autosaving-and-post-revisions-in-wordpress" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-02-23T10:49:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Aaron James Young</name></author><id>tag:ajy.co,2011-02-23:web/stop-autosaving-and-post-revisions-in-wordpress</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just a quick post. Wordpress's autosave and revisioning system has its
good points but there are several reasons you may want to disable it.
Just be aware of the potential consequences - you're more apt to lose
work if you don't save consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I do this for nearly all the Wordpress sites I build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following code goes in the wp-config.php file, just before the
"that's all, stop editing, happy blogging" line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;define(&amp;#39;WP_POST_REVISIONS&amp;#39;, false);define(&amp;#39;AUTOSAVE_INTERVAL&amp;#39;,7200);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Technically, this doesn't disable autosave - it sets the autosave
interval to two hours.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="wordpress"></category><category term="tweaks"></category><category term="code"></category></entry><entry><title>Updated workspace</title><link href="http://ajy.co/personal/updated-workspace" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-01-30T18:20:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Aaron James Young</name></author><id>tag:ajy.co,2011-01-30:personal/updated-workspace</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been updating my desk/work area:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: My Skeleton wordpress theme has evolved quite a bit since this post. It's not up to
date at Github anymore, sorry. The theme has almost completely changed although many of the
principles I outline here are still in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another great place for you to find a skeleton theme is from Automattic themselves: See the
&lt;a href="http://underscores.me"&gt;Underscores theme&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Back to the article&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the blank Wordpress theme that I use as a development basis.
When I design new websites, I start with this set of files and add,
subtract, or rearrange code as needed. I thought I'd share it in case
anyone finds it useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/aaronjamesyoung/Skeleton-Wordpress-Theme"&gt;View files or Download theme at Github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what's in the theme:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A set of all the core files in standard Wordpress themes:
    header.php, footer.php, index.php, etc. Includes archive and search
    templates and all the usual stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use stylesheets a little differently as a matter of convenience to
    me: The standard WP style.css contains ONLY theme information and a
    comment. All the styles for the site are in the CSS folder, and the
    header.php contains links to those stylesheets. I have three
    stylesheets in that folder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;style.css - contains all the styles for the website.
    &lt;del&gt;I use the
    &lt;a href="http://readableweb.com/mo-bulletproofer-font-face-css-syntax/"&gt;Mo'Bulletproof @font-face syntax&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="http://ajy.co/tech/font-face-for-obscure-linux-browsers"&gt;I've found&lt;/a&gt; to
    have the best cross-browser compatibility&lt;/del&gt;. I've switched
    to the new sparkly &lt;a href="http://www.fontspring.com/blog/the-new-bulletproof-font-face-syntax"&gt;Fontspring @font-face syntax&lt;/a&gt; now!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reset.css - based on the &lt;a href="http://borderleft.com/labs/"&gt;Toucan CSS Reset&lt;/a&gt; and including a
    lot of &lt;a href="http://lessframework.com/"&gt;Less Framework&lt;/a&gt; concepts (like media queries for
    different screen sizes), plus some custom classes for a
    quasi-grid. There's actually a fair amount of stuff going on in
    this file. It is @import'ed into style.css.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ie.css - Currently included with a "less than IE 9" conditional
    statement. This might need to be changed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A custom functions.php file that contains a lot of stuff that I've
    found in various places. Includes: A custom excerpt, code to clean
    out the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; of various metadata, support for shortcodes in text
    widgets, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's a function in functions.php to include only one copy of
    jQuery (from Google's CDN). This is nice because plugins tend to
    include their own copies of jQuery and sometimes that causes
    conflicts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's a scripts/custom.js file for all your custom javascript
    code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The theme supports Wordpress 3 Custom Menus - create a menu in WP's
    admin section, and add it as a widget in one of the widget areas,
    which leads me to...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are four widget areas: Header, Nav, Sidebar, Footer. These are
    places that I often like to stick widgets like text boxes. The Nav
    widget area is a great place to put the WP3 Menu that you create,
    like I said.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML5!! The theme uses HTML5 semantic elements throughout. There's
    no wrapper div - instead the main header, section, and footer all
    have "&lt;code&gt;class='body'&lt;/code&gt;". This usually works well as a faux-wrapper and
    is more semantic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are a couple template html files that I use while designing
    the site so I don't have to have LAMPP running all the time in the
    early development stages. This allows me to tweak my document
    structure and to style various elements: template.html is a pretty
    much blank document, while template-example.html contains a bunch of
    filler text and various elements (h1, h2, del, etc.). This filler
    text is taken from the Toucan CSS Reset demo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's nothing groundbreaking here. I've compiled stuff from a lot of
different sources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The theme is based heavily on Chris Coyier's [Blank wordpress
    theme][] (originally in HTML4, but I've HTML5'd it up)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few resources from (and originally inspired by) Amber Weinberg's
    &lt;a href="http://www.amberweinberg.com/hijinks-a-wordpress-basic-framework/"&gt;Hijinks theme&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;several of the functions from functions.php are from the Digging
    into Wordpress articles &lt;a href="http://digwp.com/2010/03/wordpress-functions-php-template-custom-functions/"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://digwp.com/2010/04/wordpress-custom-functions-php-template-part-2/"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; on customizing your
    functions.php&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As noted above, my CSS reset is based on &lt;a href="http://borderleft.com/labs/"&gt;Toucan CSS Reset&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm using a lot of stuff also from the &lt;a href="http://lessframework.com/"&gt;Less Framework&lt;/a&gt;, primarily
    media queries which allow the site to adapt to different screen
    sizes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some resources from &lt;a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/"&gt;HTML5 Boilerplate&lt;/a&gt; and related projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other miscellaneous tidbits from different places scattered about
    the Intertubes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Issues:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;functions.php needs to be cleaned up a little more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I may not be using HTML5 semantic elements correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may not find this minimal enough for your use - too much markup,
    etc. Like I say, for me it's a good starting place for my projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My IE conditional statements will need to be tweaked over time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There may very well be typos. Though I've been using this for some
    time, I'm just now working on really polishing it up. So if
    something doesn't work, let me know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As I'm adding and changing stuff frequently, sometimes I post it
    before testing (ha!). I'm sure you'll love it if your WP3 menus
    don't work or something. If I've used it in a live site, it'll work
    because by that point it'll be tested. Let me know if you find bad
    code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted above, &lt;a href="https://github.com/aaronjamesyoung/Skeleton-Wordpress-Theme"&gt;view files or download the theme at Github&lt;/a&gt; if you're interested. Leave a comment, get
in touch, etc. if you have issues. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edited to add: I just remembered this: the reset.css file contains
&lt;code&gt;box-sizing: border-box;&lt;/code&gt; on certain elements. This is a potential
gotcha because when you specify width on those elements, it will
calculate width to include the border and padding set on the element.
See css/reset.css lines \~100-105 for this.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="wordpress"></category><category term="code"></category></entry><entry><title>Letters to the Editor</title><link href="http://ajy.co/personal/letters-to-the-editor" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-01-10T12:41:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Aaron James Young</name></author><id>tag:ajy.co,2011-01-10:personal/letters-to-the-editor</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;OK, time for a quick fun post that has nothing to do with anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, I've collected a few funny letters to the editor. All the
ones shown here are from the World in Coos Bay, Oregon. I decided it was
time to share some. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Letter 1: Editor is in the Jaws of Stupidity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Jaws of Stupidity" - now there's a good metaphor. I've got to remember
to use that one sometime. This letter, which appears to be in response
to an editorial by Kathy Erickson (the then-editor of the newspaper), is
very strongly written but doesn't really appear to say anything. Not
anything comprehensible, at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also worth noting: That wasn't a great day for letters all around. So
click the image below for BIGGER! I didn't want to crop out the other
letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://ajy.co/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/stupidity-716x655.jpg" title="stupidity" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Letter 2: What really caused the Feb. 7th storm?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what kind of world this guy thinks he lives in. I wonder
what Peter DeFazio thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://ajy.co/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/storm.jpg" title="storm" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Letter 3: Enjoying a sunny, soothing interlude&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, a breath of fresh air and positivity in the midst of so much
turmoil. I'm glad this person is happy and carefree. I was just
thinking, when I wake up in the morning and I'm in a good mood, the
first thing I want to do is write a letter to the editor to tell 60,000
people that I'm happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://ajy.co/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/sun.jpg" title="sun" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Letter 4: A Bavarian eatery would be nice in North Bend&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems there's a fairly sizeable group of people in North Bend
(probably mostly in the 85+ age group) that feel that their city is
perfect and Coos Bay is constantly plotting to take over (consolidating
the two cities has appeared on several ballots and would probably make
economic sense for both cities and the larger region).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This person, though, has found something that North Bend needs: a
Bavarian restaurant. Apparently, they can prove that there is no
Bavarian restaurant by listing EVERY OTHER kind of restaurant that IS in

&lt;p&gt;I was at Fred Meyer a while back, and found O-Hana Salsa. It was on sale
and I noticed it's made in Bend, so I decided to try some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's good stuff! The label doesn't look real great, and I'm not sure
what the name means, but the salsa itself is quite tasty. At this point,
I'm about ready to declare it the Official Salsa of Aaron James Young.
I'm sure they'll be thrilled.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="delicious"></category><category term="bend"></category></entry><entry><title>I'm in the Statesman Journal!</title><link href="http://ajy.co/web/im-in-the-statesman-journal" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-12-17T22:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Aaron James Young</name></author><id>tag:ajy.co,2010-12-17:web/im-in-the-statesman-journal</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Statesman Journal article" src="http://ajy.co/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/2010-12-17-214953.jpg" title="Statesman Journal article" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

asked me if I would like a business profile in their weekly community

"yes!" The profile was in the South Salem Weekly section of the

for me - it has all the features I want and none of what I don't want.
Worklog is a Linux program that uses an ncurses interface in the
terminal to track your time spent on various projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A description from the author of the program:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;﻿﻿﻿"Worklog is a program that helps you keep track of your time. I
wrote this program because I have several projects that require me to
keep a timesheet. I sometimes spend 5 minutes here and there doing
miscellaneous administrative tasks. Rather than invoke an editor on a
timesheet file for every little segment of my time spent doing these
tasks, I wanted to leave a clock running and indicate with one or two
keystrokes the onset or change of any given task. Worklog is a simple
ncurses based program to do just that."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worklog can be (kind of) found at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[http://www.truxton.com/~trux/software/][] - the author's home page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=worklog"&gt;http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=worklog&lt;/a&gt; - Ubuntu
    package page, choose your version of Ubuntu (currently Maverick) for
    a description of the package&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ubuntu, Worklog can be installed with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install worklog&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's an older utility that doesn't look to have been updated in the last
4 1/2 years at least, but it gets the job done. When you install it, you
can read more about it with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;man worklog&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More Instructions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with the man page, there's not much documentation out there. So I'd
like to provide a quick overview and a couple of tips for using Worklog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you start using Worklog, you need to create a "projects" file.
Use a text editor to create a text file called "projects" and save it in
the current directory. The Worklog man page contains an example of what
could go in this file (lines starting with # are comments and do not
affect Worklog):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# Worklog project file&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;# note that projects appear in Worklog in REVERSE order&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;B:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;BOWER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;consultation&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;L:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;LIS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;consultation&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;R:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Research&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;D:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;DEC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;system&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;administration&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;P:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Problems&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;S:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Sugar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;administration&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;r:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Reading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;NetNews&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Each entry is a Project that you can track your time working on. There is
no project hierarchy - that is, you can't create sub-projects (or you
will have to enter them as separate projects). This isn't an issue for
me, personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can open a terminal and type "worklog" to start Worklog. You'll
see something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Worklog at startup" src="http://ajy.co/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/2010-10-11-133027.png" title="Worklog at startup" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you want to start logging time on your BOWER consultation, type
"B" and the timer will start. Type "R" for tracking "Research" time, or
"r" for "Reading NetNews". Note the bottom entry in the projects list,
"no category yet". Pressing Enter ("CR" stands for "Carriage Return",
meaning "Enter") will start logging time automatically and you will have
the option of assigning an existing category to that time later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Press "Delete" (and again when they tell you to) to quit the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that when you start Worklog for the first time, it creates a new
text file in your home directory for EACH entry in the "projects" file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Worklog creates several text files in the current working directory." src="http://ajy.co/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/2010-10-11-133447.png" title="Worklog creates several text files in the current working directory." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, I prefer to use a subdirectory for Worklog. I create a
folder called "worklog" with my "projects" file inside, then I run
Worklog with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd ~/worklog &amp;amp;&amp;amp; worklog&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so my home directory stays a little cleaner. I've actually created a
bash alias for this command (plus an additional command to cd back to my
home directory after I quit Worklog):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;alias worktimer='cd ~/worklog &amp;amp;&amp;amp; worklog &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cd ~/'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update: I just learned a trick from &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/comment/30693542/"&gt;this Lifehacker comment&lt;/a&gt; -
create a text file in your home directory called ".hidden" that lists
files and folders that should be, well, hidden by default. This is
another good way to keep your home directory clean. It works like a
charm.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few more screenshots that show operation of Worklog:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Worklog, timer paused" src="http://ajy.co/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/2010-10-11-134554.png" title="Worklog, timer paused" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pressed "B" to track the Bower consultation time, then pressed "Space"
to pause the clock. The instructions are pretty straightforward from
here. Note: "31.00 seconds (total 31.00 seconds)" - it tracks the time
in the current session as well as the total time you've spent working on
the project. If you close Worklog and come back later, it'll still
remember how much time you've spent on your project. You can use "+" and
"-" to add or subtract any amount of time as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Worklog, entering a comment" src="http://ajy.co/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/2010-10-11-135101.png" title="Worklog, entering a comment" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Press "Enter" to stop tracking time and enter a comment on your work in
this session. Press "Enter" again to go back to the main Worklog
interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A kind of funky annoyance is that Worklog counts hours and minutes in
hundredths, so 19.30 minutes is actually somewhere near 19 minutes and
18 seconds. It IS handy for calculating based on an hourly rate, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A nice perk...&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Worklog stores all its data in the text files I mentioned
previously, you can see a full summary of your work by opening the
correct file in your text editor. Here, you can view or edit times,
dates, or descriptions of your work. Want to start over each month? Just
make a folder for the past month and move your old time logs in there to
archive them, and Worklog will generate new clean files next time you
start it up. The text files could be edited or read through scripting or
synced via Dropbox. I find it really flexible and cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;In conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worklog is pretty easy to use and is extremely lightweight, but there's
not much information available about it and screenshots are few and far
between. Hopefully this post helps out a little.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Chrome-like Floating Statusbar for Firefox</title><link href="http://ajy.co/linux/chrome-like-floating-statusbar-for-firefox" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-08-09T11:49:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Aaron James Young</name></author><id>tag:ajy.co,2010-08-09:linux/chrome-like-floating-statusbar-for-firefox</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://ajy.co/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/2010-08-09-112641.png" title="2010-08-09-11:26:41" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I'm a little crazy about screen space. I don't like the statusbar
on the bottom of my firefox window. The only thing that I really use it
for is to check the address of links that I'm hovering over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the way Chrome and other browsers do this - a little box appears
with the link address. So I decided to do this to Firefox. This isn't an
extension, just a little userContent.css hack and some icons. The
screenshot above shows what it looks like for me in Firefox when I hover
over a link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ajy.co/floating-statusbar.zip"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Download Zip File&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - August 19, 2010&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;August 19, 2010 - fixed variable margin/padding bug&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;August 9, 2010 - initial upload&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize, the zip file above contains a few icons and a
userContent.css file. If you've modified userContent.css before, you
know how this works. Basically, it applies some styles to certain
elements on ALL websites that you browse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Instructions:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download and extract the zip file. You'll find a "README" file that
contains these instructions, a "userContent.css" file, and a folder
labeled "floating-statusbar-icons".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find your Firefox profile directory. In Linux, this is at
&lt;code&gt;~/.mozilla/firefox/&amp;lt;YOUR PROFILE DIRECTORY&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Inside your profile
directory is a folder called "chrome".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "userContent.css" file and the "floating-statusbar-icons" folder
need to be moved into the "chrome" folder in your profile directory.
(Note, if you've customized your userContent.css before, you need to
just copy-paste the code from my provided css file into yours).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restart Firefox. Go to "View" -&gt; uncheck "Status Bar". This isn't
necessary, but isn't the whole point to get rid of your statusbar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Oh, a cool bonus:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hover over an image link and you get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://ajy.co/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/2010-08-09-112900.png" title="2010-08-09-11:29:00" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little icons will indicate the type of file that's being linked to.
There's also a lock for https links, a "new tab" icon for links that
will open in a new tab/window, and an envelope icon for mailto: links.
There are several filetypes that will show icons, so have fun
experimenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this isn't perfect due to some limitations to CSS and some
laziness on my part. This won't completely replace your statusbar if you
use it for MORE than what's described above (showing a link address when
you hover over the link). It won't show your weather and it won't show
icons for your Firefox addons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Credit:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm using icons from the Silk Icon set (1.3) by Mark James:
&lt;a href="http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/"&gt;http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Want more?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got something to add? Let me know and I'll update the zip file. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Cycling over Bear Camp Road</title><link href="http://ajy.co/personal/cycling-over-bear-camp-road" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-07-26T21:19:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Aaron James Young</name></author><id>tag:ajy.co,2010-07-26:personal/cycling-over-bear-camp-road</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, last Thursday I rode my bike from Gold Beach to Indian Mary Park,
near Merlin, near Grants Pass Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was not easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit to add - if you're arriving at this article from an online search:
Bear Camp Road is a one and a half lane wide paved forest service road
between Agness, OR and Galice, OR. It follows a large ridge between
these two towns. It reaches an elevation of nearly 4,800 feet and should
not be traversed in the winter (though local people frequently travel
part of the distance to get to snow or for work-related reasons). During
the summer it recieves quite a bit of use from rafters and other people
traveling between Gold Beach and Grants Pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started at Gold Beach High School around 8:00 a.m. It was a beautiful
morning, but quite windy. I looped around the Gold Beach airstrip, up to
the highway, and out Jerry's Flat Road toward Agness. This is the route
used by the &lt;a href="http://goldbeachbiketherogue.org"&gt;Ride the Rogue&lt;/a&gt; event in September, which I can HIGHLY
recommend after doing this ride. This was my favorite part of the ride,
beautiful and a very rideable road. It's capped off near Agness with a
long (and fun) descent to a great bridge. The pavement is great for
riding, lots of patches but pretty smooth overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple miles after the bridge, I took a right turn on Bear Camp Road.
Here the fun begins. It's a 16-mile uphill from the river to the Bear
Camp overlook at around 4,800 feet up in the Klamath Mountains. There
are a lot of beautiful views but the miles tick by slowly. There are two
overlooks: the Siskiyou overlook about 10 miles up the hill (near
milepost 26; the mileposts are painted on the road and start at the
eastern end) and the Bear Camp overlook 16 miles up the hill (at
milepost 21). The road is windy and steep in places, with only a little
relief from time to time. Pavement is good, with some cracks &amp;amp; patches
but overall great for riding. There are a few very short gravel
stretches, maybe a total of 1/4 mile on gravel over the entire road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a nice stop at the Bear Camp Overlook (where I ate some food in
the car due to being bombed by gigantic flies) I took off for a 21-mile
mostly-downhill ride to the Galice area. There's a little uphill on this
stretch but nothing too bad. After a while I passed out of the Siskiyou
National Forest and the road goes to county maintenance, and the nice
smooth pavement changes over to a kind of rough chip seal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the downhill was great, but the worst part was from milepost 8
to milepost 4 where the road basically drops straight down the side of a
cliff (actually "straight" is a bad word, it's really curvy). I'm not
one to just coast down this kind of stuff at 50 mph, especially with the
chip seal, so I was leaning on the brakes for a while. After milepost 4
things get much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hear talk of a "shoe tree" but didn't see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was pretty spent at the bottom of the hill but wanted to ride along
the Rogue River for a while again. It was hot enough, and I was sore
enough, that we decided to call it good at Indian Mary Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total mileage: 72&lt;/p&gt;

wild today: The &lt;a href="http://www.fontspring.com/blog/the-new-bulletproof-font-face-syntax"&gt;Fontspring @font-face Syntax&lt;/a&gt;. This simple syntax
looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@font-face&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've checked this syntax in Konqueror 4.6 (KHTML) and gtk-webkit, as
well as Opera 11 on Linux. Each browser displays the @font-face font
correctly. Further testing is needed in some various browsers (including
different versions of IE) to determine if everything is working
perfectly and how well the syntax performs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Back to the original article...&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;@font-face is an increasingly popular method of delivering custom fonts
to display online. The syntax for using @font-face in a CSS file is
pretty straightforward, but there are a number of cross-browser issues
that complicate the matter. I'm going to describe the best syntax I've
found that supports the largest number of browsers, including a couple
Linux browsers that don't seem to support other syntaxes (is that a
word?) that I've found online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;"Obscure"?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't check just now, but I'm sure Firefox is the most popular Linux
browser. There are, however, a number of people in the Linux community
who harbor a dissatisfaction with Firefox and use an alternative
browser. So, while the browsers described here are not widely used
overall, they are pretty well-known among Linux users. The browsers are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Konqueror, the KDE web browser. Konqueror uses the KHTML rendering
    engine, which (back in the day) served as the basis for the
    now-popular Webkit engine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Epiphany and Midori are Webkit browsers. They both use the new GTK
    port of Webkit to render pages. While Webkit-GTK is very similar to
    the Webkit engines that power Safari and Chrome, there are a few
    minor differences. One of the differences is the treatment of
    @font-face syntax.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Basis:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I originally started from Paul Irish's Bulletproof @font-face syntax
here:
&lt;a href="http://paulirish.com/2009/bulletproof-font-face-implementation-syntax/"&gt;http://paulirish.com/2009/bulletproof-font-face-implementation-syntax/&lt;/a&gt;
and modified it a fair amount. That article is good reading and my
intent is not to repeat it here. I also don't intend to be speaking with
any authority on this subject, I'm just sharing what works for me.
Anyway, read that article. A fair amount of what I'm writing is under
the assumption you've read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the Bulletproof syntax by Paul Irish (happy face and all):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@font-face&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Graublau Web&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;GraublauWeb.eot&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* for IE */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;☺&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;GraublauWeb.woff&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;woff&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;GraublauWeb.otf&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;opentype&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;GraublauWeb.svg#grablau&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;svg&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* these are for other browsers */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;My process - Issues and Resolution:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my testing, it seems that GTK-webkit chokes on "local" and
    doesn't read the rest of the final "src" line above. Therefore,
    @font-face doesn't work. To resolve this, I moved "local" to a new
    "src" line. This makes IE choke (that is, the custom font does not
    display), but I'll take care of it later:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;eot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;filesrc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;☺&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.lots&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;stuff&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I found that no matter where the "local" declaration is,
    Konqueror chokes. So I just got rid of it. IE still chokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fix IE, I use a conditional comment to include the IE declaration
    separately:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!--[if IE]&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;    @font-face {&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;        font-family: &amp;#39;Graublau Web&amp;#39;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;        src: url(&amp;#39;GraublauWeb.eot&amp;#39;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;    }&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;![endif]--&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I actually just put this in a separate IE stylesheet. This isn't a
problem for me since I almost always use a specific IE stylesheet.
My normal stylesheet contains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@font-face&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Graublau Web&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;GraublauWeb.woff&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;woff&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;GraublauWeb.otf&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;opentype&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;GraublauWeb.svg#grablau&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;svg&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Browser Support:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tested this in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firefox 3.6 (Linux)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opera 10.5 (Linux)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Midori, using WebkitGtk+ 1.1.22 (fixed!) (remember, this browser
    uses the exact same Webkit engine as Epiphany, Uzbl, Jumanji, surf,
    vimprobable, etc., etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Konqueror 4.4.2 (fixed!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IE6, 7, 8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Chrome (Windows)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these browsers display the @font-face font using my syntax above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;IE Gotcha's:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not using a separate IE stylesheet? You won't like this solution,
    sorry. It requires double declarations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the syntax I just described, IE will get a 404 "not found"
    message as it attempts to download a file that doesn't exist. See
    Paul Irish's post for more about this issue. See below for the
    workaround.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft has expressed support for the WOFF format. This is good in
    the long-term but in the short-term I wonder if it could create more
    problems with the release of IE9 and the need to support older
    versions of IE as well. An alternative syntax may be needed to
    deliver the WOFF font to IE9 and the EOT to earlier versions of IE.
    Gosh, I hope not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;IE 404 problem:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, IE gets a 404 as it requests the WOFF font
(actually, it requests a really long string that's not even a real
address... Paul Irish's post describes this in more detail). The Mo'
Bulletproofer syntax by Richard Fink (mentioned below) prevents this so
my current syntax is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!--[if IE]&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;@font-face { /* I actually put this in my ie.css file */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;    font-family: &amp;#39;Graublau Web&amp;#39;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;    src: url(&amp;#39;GraublauWeb.eot&amp;#39;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;    }&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;![endif]--&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;@font-face&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* this goes in my normal css file */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Graublau Web&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(//:)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;no404&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;GraublauWeb.woff&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;woff&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;GraublauWeb.otf&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;opentype&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;GraublauWeb.svg#grablau&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;svg&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So I use the Mo'Bulletproof syntax in my projects, based on this sort of
trial-and-error testing system. Note, I don't usually put these in my
HTML files of course, they go in their respective css stylesheets
without any conditional comments or HTML tags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;No perfect solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it's Paul Irish's Bulletproof syntax with a smiley face, or the
"url(//:)" in the Mo'Bulletproof-er, both solutions contain code that is
only a hack to make IE behave. I don't see a real semantic difference
between the two, and I'm OK with double declarations since I have a
separate IE stylesheet anyway in my development workflow. In my opinion,
the best I can do is to make sure the syntax works for as many users as
possible.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="css"></category><category term="font"></category><category term="code"></category><category term="linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Avoid the Domain Registry of America!</title><link href="http://ajy.co/web/so-i-got-a-letter-in-the-mail" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-04-22T12:19:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Aaron James Young</name></author><id>tag:ajy.co,2010-04-22:web/so-i-got-a-letter-in-the-mail</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I got a letter in the mail from the Domain Registry of America. Here's the gist of the letter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a domain name expiring within a few months&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I should transfer registration of the domain name to DRoA and renew
    through them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a scan of the letter (click for bigger):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ajy.co/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/paper.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.aaronjamesyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/paper-150x150.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter itself seemed kind of shady and after Googling the company,
I'm pretty annoyed with their "marketing" tactics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The letter has a large heading in the top right that says "Domain
    Name Expiration Notice". While I suppose the letter is, in a sense,
    a notice that I have a domain name that expires (fairly) soon, it's
    misleading because it implies the company has some sort of authority
    on what will happen with my domain name and that I should take
    immediate action with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bottom third of the letter is a detachable payment form where I
    can fill in my credit card info and a couple other things and (I
    guess) automatically transfer/renew the domain name with DRoA.
    Again, it appears misleading because it looks like a bill. They do
    note (in the middle of the letter) that "This notice is not a bill"
    but the letter seems to be formatted to take advantage of people who
    scan and act immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Registry_of_America"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; mentions that the company is located in Canada but has
    a mailing address in Buffalo, NY. Not a problem, but odd for a
    company called "Domain Registry of America" and the separate mailing
    address gives off bad vibes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wikipedia also says the following [quoted directly from the
    article]: "In 2003, the Federal Trade Commission reached a
    settlement with the company for practices such as
    transferring domain registrations to their service under the guise
    of domain renewal, a practice known as domain slamming, and having
    hidden fees. Despite this action, the company still sends
    mass direct mail to consumers resembling invoices with 'domain name
    expiration notice' in bold print."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One more Wikipedia quote: "They have also now (Aug 2009) started
    emailing potential customers with an email scam, purporting to
    indicate that the transfer of a domain is 'not complete at this
    time', and requesting the domain owner follows a series of steps to
    complete the transfer to DRoA. These are highly misleading emails."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They charge \$30 to register a domain name for one year. Many
    companies charge 1/3 to 1/2 that price, including my current
    registrar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... what to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note, I'm not calling this a "scam" though that word has been used
    by others in connection with this service. However (even without any
    research), I would guess that they actually provide the service they
    advertise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you get a letter or email from this company or another, remember
    where you've registered your domain name and who you SHOULD be
    receiving notices &amp;amp; bills from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the letter carefully.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rather than renewing your domain name by clicking links in your
    email, instead use your browser and go directly to the site where
    you registered the domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is OK to transfer a domain name if you want, there's no problem
    with that. There are many other registrars that do a good job and
    are competitively priced. And that don't spam people with misleading
    letters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In defense of the DRoA, I would imagine it's tough to market domain
registration services in a way that's interesting and creative ;).&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="scam"></category><category term="domain"></category></entry><entry><title>Improved Zim Clipper</title><link href="http://ajy.co/linux/improved-zim-clipper" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-04-08T21:34:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Aaron James Young</name></author><id>tag:ajy.co,2010-04-08:linux/improved-zim-clipper</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Final edit: The Zim plugin mentioned immediately below is now called
"Quick Note" and is integrated with the default Zim download. So the
script that I describe and provide here is now obsolete.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;(Edit 4/13/10: The Zim author has implemented a "Drop Window" plugin
that provides this clipping functionality. It is in the Zim bzr source
on Launchpad and - I would suppose - will be included in the next
release of Zim. You can get it now from bzr or use the below script
until the next version is released)&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://zim-wiki.org/"&gt;Zim Desktop Wiki&lt;/a&gt; is a note-taking program that I've been using
to keep track of all kinds of information - it's my digital notebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've always liked the Evernote-style clipping functionality, where I can
select some text in my web browser or another program, hit a key
combination, and have that text "clipped" or saved to my note-taking
program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ajy.co/linux/zim-clipping-script-on-ubuntu-linux"&gt;Some time ago&lt;/a&gt;, I posted a small Linux bash script that accomplished
this. It gets the job done but has several obvious drawbacks (I
basically pieced it together with little knowledge). I've noticed my
post has been linked from the Zim Wiki Tips and Tricks page, so I've
been motivated to make the script a little better. Please note that this
is just a temporary solution - the Zim author appears to be implementing
this feature with tighter integration into Zim itself. Until that is
complete, you're welcome to download this and go crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My new script (presented below) has a few improvements over the bash script I posted earlier:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basic functionality:&lt;/strong&gt; Select text that you want to remember. Hit a
key combination, provide a title and location for your note, and the
script will create a Zim page with the proper parameters and the
selected text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem with old script:&lt;/strong&gt; Too many popup windows! The old script
would pop up three windows in succession, asking for the note title,
then the note location, then asking for any additional text to add to
the note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution:&lt;/strong&gt; Ask for everything in one window. The new script pops up a
single window with fields for the note title, note location, and the
text for the new note. The selected text is already entered in the text
field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem with old script:&lt;/strong&gt; Dependency on xsel, a little utility that
doesn't come installed by default in (for example) Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution:&lt;/strong&gt; Uses Python (see below) gtk.Clipboard, as kindly suggested
by the Zim author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem with old script:&lt;/strong&gt; Written in bash by someone (me) who doesn't
know how to script in bash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution:&lt;/strong&gt; The new script is written in Python by someone (me) who
doesn't know how to write Python. Actually, it's kind of an improvement
because from here I can start to learn Python, and continue to refine
the script. I may post updates here from time to time, but don't count
on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Directions (sort of detailed):&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download and extract the file below&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It contains three files: zimclip (the python script) and two
    ZimclipWindow UI files that create the window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move the UI files (ZimclipWindow.ui and ZimclipWindow.xml) to a
    location where they're out of your way. Note where you've put them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open zimclip in a text editor. There are two user-configurable lines
    near the top (yeah, I know this is bad, just do it, OK?).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter the location of the UI files (the folder that you put them in)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter the location of the Zim notebook/namespace where you want to
    file the notes created by this script. Remember that with Zim,
    Folders ==  Notebooks (and namespaces are in sub-directories). You
    will be able to choose each time you use the script, but it's nice
    to have a default.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move zimclip to your executable path and create a global keybinding
    to launch it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use it, select some text and hit the keybinding. You'll need to
provide a title for your note and a folder location (Zim uses a pretty
straightforward folder structure for pages). Hit "Ok" and (when you're
ready) go to Zim and choose "Tools" - "Rebuild Index". Your note
should show up in the index sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, here is the &lt;a href="http://ajy.co/zimclip.zip"&gt;download link for the zip file&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I was
kind of proud of a couple parts of it, so I thought I'd paste them in
here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Having a website should be a responsibility.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should check the entire site from time to time to make sure that
    information is current and accurate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have dates on your site, they should be kept current. For
    example, a blog or news section should be updated frequently and
    regularly. If the most recent news item is from sometime in 2006,
    the site will not be credible to viewers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the same way, people change over time. If you have photos of
    staff or other people on your site, the photos should be kept
    current.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t spread yourself too thin - don’t take on more than you can
    handle in a website. If you have two blogs, a news section, recent
    photos, and a section of restaurant reviews, you probably will be
    burned out trying to keep it all up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Use your site as a part of your marketing strategy.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain other marketing materials as well, not everyone is online&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reference your site in your other marketing materials&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure that your site exists for your customers, not for you.
    Consider why people are coming to your site and what information
    they will be looking for - and make this information easy to get.
    For example, on a software download site, users probably won’t want
    to read a long statement about the history and development of the
    software - instead, the “Download” button should be prominently
    displayed and the download process should be simple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you like your site&lt;/strong&gt; well enough that it can replace Google as your
home page? I actually enjoy browsing through my own site. I figure, if I
like it so much, my target audience should also. Of course, this is a
general statement, but it’s a good rule of thumb.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="clients"></category><category term="strategy"></category></entry><entry><title>California Trip, October 2009</title><link href="http://ajy.co/photos/california-trip-october-2009" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-10-10T11:39:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Aaron James Young</name></author><id>tag:ajy.co,2009-10-10:photos/california-trip-october-2009</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;[gallery columns="4" orderby="ID"]&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Back from California!</title><link href="http://ajy.co/personal/back-from-california" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-10-07T18:15:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Aaron James Young</name></author><id>tag:ajy.co,2009-10-07:personal/back-from-california</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We're back from our California trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trip was a LOT of driving, but we saw lots of stuff. Most of my
pictures are of Red Rock Canyon state park in the Mojave Desert, and
Sequoia National Park. Evelyn and I skipped Yosemite this time -
probably not a good decision but we really needed to get home; and we'd
rather spend a little more time with Yosemite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Californians were pretty rude on the road, but nice in person.
They were happy to help out an Oregonian who was having trouble pumping
gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funniest vanity license plate: "THE NERD"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funniest city names: "Yreka" and "Chowchilla"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funniest city slogan: "Mojave: The Gateway to Space". I thought that was
a pretty bold claim - some towns are happy with just being the "gateway
to the coast".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biggest farm town in the world: Fresno (480,000 - the same size as
Sacramento)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most lacking: Coffee shops (it was pulling teeth to even find a
Starbucks in the whole state)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replacement for coffee shops: Liquor stores, they're like coffee up
here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amount of fun it is to drive to LA on Dodger game night: Zero&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number of rides at Six Flags Magic Mountain that Evelyn can do before
she gets sick: 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number of rides for Aaron: He didn't even try, he went to Red Rock
canyon instead where he could, well, stay on the ground&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miles logged: 2,300&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="family"></category><category term="travel"></category><category term="california"></category></entry><entry><title>Google Maps route elevation profiles</title><link href="http://ajy.co/web/google-maps-route-elevation-profiles" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-09-04T11:43:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Aaron James Young</name></author><id>tag:ajy.co,2009-09-04:web/google-maps-route-elevation-profiles</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Welcome! Note that this article is several years old. Please excuse me for pointing out things that are more obvious now... like how to plot a route on Google Maps :) The GPSVisualizer tip partway through the article is still good and I use it regularly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't anything I've made, but it's a cool combination of tools I
came across for mapping running and biking routes and finding their
elevation profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Maps introduced a very cool "routes" feature a while back that
allows you to find directions between two points, and drag that route
around to find alternate routes. You can add intermediate destinations
or "node" points along the route. I've been finding distances of
potential biking routes by simply using Google Maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once at the Google Maps website, right-click at the starting point of
your route and choose "Directions from Here". Follow your route to major
intersection, and right-click on the map again and choose "Directions To
Here". Google Maps will automatically fill in a suggested route. If you
don't like it, click and drag it until it's the route you'd like to take
between those two points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, find another point along your route and choose "Add
Destination". Again, adjust the route if you want. Google will usually
choose the most direct driving route from point to point. Keep adding
more destinations until you're at the finish!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually you can map a lengthy run with 5-10 destinations. This is MUCH
quicker than using route mapping tools like the USATF running route
tool, where it draws a straight line between each point you click on the
map. The drawback is that routes are more limited to roads, so this
would be pointless on a trail route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now you have a nice running or cycling route, with accurate distance.
Now, directly above the map, you'll see the words "Print, Send, Link" in
the blue bar. Click "Link" and copy the email/IM link given. Head over
to http://www.gpsvisualizer.com and click "Draw a profile" in the top
menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find the box that says "Or provide the URL of Data on the Web" at bottom
right of the page. Paste your map link here. This site will generate an
elevation profile graph of the route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It only takes a few minutes to do this. I might consider working
something like this into a future version of TrueGoal.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="personal"></category></entry><entry><title>New plates!</title><link href="http://ajy.co/personal/new-plates" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-08-17T18:28:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Aaron James Young</name></author><id>tag:ajy.co,2009-08-17:personal/new-plates</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;![100_2060][]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;It was stolen (perhaps by the Hamburglar).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It gave up ("Look at all those stairs! I can't go up all those!").

I ran on a team with my
family (all except David). Here's how things went:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drive to Coos Bay on Friday afternoon and watch the Coos County
    track meet. Eat some dinner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wake up at 4:00 a.m. This run had better be a LOT of fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leave at 4:30 a.m. to drive to Roseburg in time for our 7:00 start.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start! My mom takes leg 1 out toward Lookingglass in the cool
    overcast weather. At least it's dry. Leg 1 is mostly uphill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We see a jeep drive by like three times during leg 2 (Dad) and leg 3
    (Steph). On my leg (4), I see it being towed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I run leg 4. Still cloudy and cold. Leg 4 is flat at first, then
    starts going up... it goes up for a while, then downhill, then up
    again on a steeper hill. Overall not an easy leg, but I felt pretty
    good and did fine powering up the hill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corey has leg 5. Ha ha ha ha ha! This is a nasty hill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mom takes over on leg 6. This finishes off the hill from leg 5 and
    then goes downhill on the other side. The Coquille River starts up
    here, as a little trickle becoming a stream. The road changes to
    gravel and the clouds cleared off on this leg. For the rest of the
    run, it was sunny and really warm, although it cooled off a bit as
    we approached the coast of course.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As Dad is running leg 7, we're driving down the gravel road in the
    middle of the forest, with waterfalls along the ever-growing
    Coquille River.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We pick up some pavement on Steph's downhill leg 8.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My leg 9 is flat, short, and hot. I didn't feel very good on this
    one. Not looking forward to the next one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After Corey's leg, Mom has a fun leg: 2 miles up, 2 miles down.
    Another runner was looking at the gentle slope rising from the
    exchange point, she said, "is it like this the whole way up?" Not
    really... she reaches the top of the hill spewing expletives... Mom
    says, "well, the last half mile was pretty steep, I guess".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fairview! Everyone's stopping at the store since it's the first one
    we've seen for hours. But Coos Bay is just over the hill..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Up Blue Ridge, and down the other side on the gravel road to Sumner.
    Almost time for me to run my third leg...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I get to run my last leg on the rolling hills from Sumner to the big
    hill I used to run several times a week to get to my house... I felt
    great, charged over the top of the big hill and down Ross Inlet
    Road.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corey finishes off by running into Eastside then Coos Bay and
    finishing at Freddy's.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time to get some 'za at Abby's. We were third in our division in
    9:27:26.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old railroad bridge over the Willamette River has been converted to
a pedestrian/bike bridge and is open now! It connects Riverfront Park
and Wallace Marine Park. Riverfront Park is a grassy park with a
carousel and wide concrete walking paths, and lots of community
festivals and things are held there; Wallace Marine is a little more
wild and has a reputation as the location of several homeless camps.
Hopefully the increased foot and bike traffic in the area - along with
city and volunteer efforts to clean out some undergrowth and maintain
running trails in the park - will make the park a more pleasant place to
be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the bridge isn't much of a looker, but it's nice to
have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="bridge2" src="http://ajy.co/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/bridge2.jpg" title="bridge2" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though it doesn't look beautiful from a distance, it's not
unpleasant when you're there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="bridge3" src="http://ajy.co/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/bridge3.jpg" title="bridge3" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lead paint issue on the bridge, it's flaking off on places
like this. It's been sealed 6-8 feet above the walkway, the picture here
shows an area above that. As far as I know, the bridge will be closed
over next winter so the issue can be taken care of.&lt;/p&gt;

fruit-on-the-bottom yogurt? Is it good? Of course, I have an opinion
about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I'm not generally an "instant-gratification,
I-want-everything-right-now" kind of guy. But I can't help but think
that the fruit is put on the bottom &lt;em&gt;simply to add an extra layer of
preparation before I can enjoy my yogurt&lt;/em&gt;. I not only have to remove the
lid and weird little foil thing, I have to stir the fruit into the
yogurt. Sometimes, I rush the stirring a little too much, and end up
spilling a glob of yogurt on the table, floor, or myself (yeah, I can
hear you snickering already. This is purely an indictment of the yogurt
companies, or as I call them, "Big Yogurt"; this has nothing to do with
my strengths and weaknesses as a yogurt stirrer). Let's face it:
Fruit-on-the-bottom is a poor user interface design for yogurt cups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what's the point anyway? If I stir the fruit into the yogurt, I've
just spent an extra 30 seconds to bring my yogurt up to "blended yogurt"
standards. The stirring (in my opinion) ruins the consistency and
temperature of the yogurt and it's impossible to stir it up evenly
anyways. There's always too much fruit left in the bottom. If I wanted
my yogurt and fruit separate, I'd eat a bunch of plain yogurt then a
couple spoonfuls of jam or a pineapple or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am only one voice, but if enough of us speak up, Big Yogurt will
eventually have to listen.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="rant"></category><category term="delicious"></category></entry><entry><title>Zena Road Run 2009</title><link href="http://ajy.co/photos/zena-road-run-2009" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-02-10T11:55:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Aaron James Young</name></author><id>tag:ajy.co,2009-02-10:photos/zena-road-run-2009</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;[gallery columns="4" orderby="ID"]&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Big Snow - December 2008</title><link href="http://ajy.co/photos/big-snow-december-2008" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-12-10T11:58:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Aaron James Young</name></author><id>tag:ajy.co,2008-12-10:photos/big-snow-december-2008</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;[gallery columns="4" orderby="ID"]&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Ants are bad.</title><link href="http://ajy.co/personal/ants-are-bad" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-07-14T19:20:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Aaron James Young</name></author><id>tag:ajy.co,2008-07-14:personal/ants-are-bad</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We've been fighting sugar ants for several days now.

trail&lt;/a&gt;. This starts just a few blocks from downtown and is a
dirt/gravel trail along the Deschutes river with views of mountains.
Bend has lots of these kinds of trails within a few minutes of town.
Thursday's dinner was at the McMenamin's downtown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday's coffee was Bend Mountain Coffee. The run was at&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=bend,+oregon&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=44.083115,-121.377876&amp;amp;spn=0.003484,0.00663&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=17" title="Map to trailhead"&gt;Shevlin
Park&lt;/a&gt;, a city park along the west end of town. It's got trails through
the forest and feels further out than it really is. Dinner was Pizza
Mondo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday's coffee was Maui Wowi (yes, that's what it is really called).
Good coffee! Evelyn ran a trail from Larkspur Park to &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=bend,+oregon&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=44.060915,-121.282411&amp;amp;spn=0.013939,0.026522&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=15"&gt;Pilot Butte&lt;/a&gt;,
then up the butte, then cooled down back to the park. Again, it's cool
that Bend has these trails in town. Dinner was... let's see... dinner
was Bella Cucina, a little Italian restaurant in the Old Mill District.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday's coffee was the Strictly Organic Coffee House. We ran at Shevlin
Park again and stopped for smoothies from Maui Wowi on our way back into
town. Dinner was Toomie's, a Thai restaurant downtown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday's coffee was Backporch Coffee. They roast their own coffee and
have some interesting blends. We ran on the &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=bend,+oregon&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=43.99726,-121.385225&amp;amp;spn=0.003489,0.00663&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=17" title="Map to trailhead"&gt;Deschutes River Trail&lt;/a&gt;
south of town. This was only a 10-minute drive from town! Shevlin Park
was even closer. Did I mention that we were impressed with how much
trail running there is in Bend? Dinner was at a seafood chain restaurant
called Anthony's. It was nice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday's coffee was Bellatazza. We then packed our stuff and left town.
On the way back, we stopped in Sisters and ran the &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=bend,+oregon&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=44.284007,-121.549644&amp;amp;spn=0.003472,0.00663&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=17" title="Map to trailhead"&gt;Eagle Rock Loop&lt;/a&gt;.
And now we're home! And it's cloudy again!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="bend"></category><category term="family"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>Bend Trip - June 2008</title><link href="http://ajy.co/photos/bend-trip-june-2008" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-06-10T12:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Aaron James Young</name></author><id>tag:ajy.co,2008-06-10:photos/bend-trip-june-2008</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;[gallery columns="4" orderby="ID"]&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Wedding Portraits</title><link href="http://ajy.co/photos/wedding-portraits" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-04-10T12:08:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Aaron James Young</name></author><id>tag:ajy.co,2008-04-10:photos/wedding-portraits</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;[gallery columns="4" orderby="ID"]&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Informal Wedding Photos</title><link href="http://ajy.co/photos/informal-wedding-photos" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-04-10T12:02:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Aaron James Young</name></author><id>tag:ajy.co,2008-04-10:photos/informal-wedding-photos</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;[gallery columns="4" orderby="ID"]&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Running Photos</title><link href="http://ajy.co/photos/running-photos" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-03-10T12:14:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Aaron James Young</name></author><id>tag:ajy.co,2008-03-10:photos/running-photos</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;[gallery columns="4" orderby="ID"]&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
